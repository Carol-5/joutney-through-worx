        <p> First day jitters... what do I do? what is expected of me? </p>

    <p>So of course any new job causes first day jitters however when changing careers at a later time in life to a very
        broad and complex world , well jitters is putting it mildly! </p>
    <p>I have worked extemely hard to learn and understand the world of technology and am grateful for the opportunity
        to use the skills I have acquired and con't to increase my knowledge.</p>
    <p>The first day was filled with getting all the passwords , meeting new people, getting my work station set up and
        finding my way around the office.</p>
    <div id="P2">
            <p>And then it was better when everyone made me feel welcome and part of the team!</p>

    <p> So now I find myself content loading/ translating to Chinese (中文) in Concrete5. My office mates have made me feel
        welcome and are patient as I learn to navigate around the CMS . Getting a glimpse at php and reading some of the
        code has given me the drive to learn more of php and so , at home I started a course.</p>
    <p>Certainly, one course will not make me an expert, however it will hopefully give me enough understanding to make
        some contributions to future projects.</p>

    <div id=P3>
        <p>Now I learn new things everyday and practice what I learned whenever I can</p>

    </div>
    <p>So now in week 4 I have met some great people, been fed, taken on a road trip, delved deeper into concrete5, gotten 2 certifications with Google Analytics, and now creating this simple website so that I can practice a new skill , SASS!</p>
    <p> I look forward to updating this little site with the new stuff I learn and the experiences that help me to grow in this new and exciting career!</p>

            <div id=P3>
                    <p>As I move closer to the end of this road, I can reflect back on my summer at Worx and what should I do now?  
                    </p>
                    <p>I  am grateful for this experience and am excited to continue on my journey to become a web developer </p>
                    <p>I did learn a few things, 
                        <ul class = "listStyle">
